## About Me

Hiya! I'm a Bioinformatics Masters student at the University of British Columbia. I did my undergrad at UBC as well, during which I studied Applied Biology. I focused mainly on molecular biology and genomics courses in my upper years. I started working in the BTL during my last year of undergrad as a Work-Learn student, and during that time I helped develop [Tigmint-Long](https://github.com/bcgsc/tigmint). Tigmint-Long is now part of the long-read assembly correction and scaffolding pipeline, [LongStitch](https://github.com/bcgsc/LongStitch), which is currently published as a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.448848v1).

For my Master's thesis, I'm working on a comparative genomics project with the fungal species _Beauveria bassiana_. _B. bassiana_ is an entomopathogenic fungus that is used as a pest management strategy against insects in agriculture and forestry, and is of interest for controlling moountain pine beetle populations in western Canada. Equipped with sequencing data for 8 different strains with various phenotypes, I'm interested in identifying the genomic basis for virulence and stress tolerance. This work involves genome annotation, variant calling, functional analysis and biosynthetic gene cluster mining.
