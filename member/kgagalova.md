### About myself
I am a traveller, explorer and a life curious person. I am particularly interested in interdisciplinary research topics and cross-knowledge collaborations. From 2018, I am also an ECOSCOPE trainee at the UBC and I like to be involved in commercial and enterpreneural activities.
In 2020, I was awarded with a MITACS accelerate fellowship for an an internship at Willow Biosciences.


### My work at Birol's Lab
My research topic at the Bioinformatics Technology Lab is about comparative genomics and genome annotations. My first project was the comparative analysis of four spruce Giga-genomes, endemic to Canada and North America. I was looking at features of local adaptation and what differentiates each of the genotypes.
The second project that I am currently involved with is the genome assembly and annotation of the spruce weevil. I am analyzing its genomics features and its large genome size which is likely driven by genome expansion.

I am interested in genome assemblies, genome annotation and comparative genomics for large and complex genomes, as I did for spruce and weevil.
