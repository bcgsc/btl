### About me
My name is Diana Lin, and I'm a first-year graduate student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, BC. In July 2019, I started my Master of Science in Bioinformatics. In 2018, I finished my Bachelor of Science in Physiology at McGill University. Following my graduation, I completed an 8-month internship here at the Bioinformatics Technology Lab.

### My work
Since starting my 8-month internship here (and continuing into my graduate studies), I have been working on the Anti-microbial Peptide (AMP) project, where I have been using homology-based search methods to datamine for AMP sequences in the spruce genomes of White spruce, Sitka spruce, and Interior spruce (and eventually Engelmann spruce). My focus (so far) has been on a certain class of AMPs: defensins. Recently, I have been analyzing differentially expressed genes in the Sitka and Interior spruce transcriptomes, in particular, looking for AMP sequences and associated sequences in its activation pathway.

In addition to the AMP project, I have been learning how to use bioinformatics tools in genome assembly and annotation, as a part of the Spruce-Up project. Using these new skills, I assembled and annotated the Engelmann spruce chloroplast genome, the white pine weevil mitochondrial genome, and annotated the White spruce chloroplast genome.
