---  

The 30th conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology ([ISMB 2022](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022)) will be held in a hybrid format (in Madison, Wisconsin, USA and virtually) from July 10-14, 2022. The Bionformatics Technology Lab will be presenting various new algorithms and data structures developed by the group in the past year. We are introducing our new <i>de novo</i> long read assembly tool, GoldRush, a modular and memory-efficient genome assembler with linear time complexity. Presentations by three of our members will describe the major steps and developments in GoldRush. In addition, we are presenting our new data structure based on stochastic tile hashing, Stash, and our new long read mapping tool using the multi-index Bloom filter.
