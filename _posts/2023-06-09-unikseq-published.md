In our study published in the [eDNA journal](https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.438), we present [unikseq](https://github.com/bcgsc/unikseq), a utility that uses words of length k (k-mers) to identify unique regions in reference genome sequences relative to tolerated (ingroup) and not-tolerated (outgroup or non-target) genome sequence sets, quickly and with low memory that can yield highly specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based eDNA assays. In our manuscript, we illustrate its application within an assay development workflow through use-case examples for the design and validation of four eDNA assays selective for American bullfrog (Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana), Burbot (Lota lota), Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and Quillback rockfish (Sebastes maliger). [unikseq is freely available on github](https://github.com/bcgsc/unikseq) and scales to large Gb-size genomes.
