In our study published in the [Environmental DNA journal](https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.438), we present [unikseq](https://github.com/bcgsc/unikseq), a comparative genomics utility that uses words of length k (k-mers) to identify unique regions in reference genome sequences quickly and with low memory that can yield highly specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based eDNA assays. In our manuscript, we illustrate its application within an animal mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) assay development workflow for the design and validation of eDNA assays selective for American bullfrog (Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana), Burbot (Lota lota), Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and Quillback rockfish (Sebastes maliger). Unikseq scales linearly in time & memory, hereby facilitating [concurrent comparison of thousands to millions of mitogenomes, SARS-CoV-2 genomes, etc., and multiple large Gbp-size genomes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcgsc/unikseq/main/unikseq-recomb2023poster.png) including those of human (3 billion nucleotides) and spruce (20 billion nucleotides). [Unikseq is freely available on github](https://github.com/bcgsc/unikseq).
