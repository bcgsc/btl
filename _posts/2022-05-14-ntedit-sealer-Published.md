Our manuscript, published in the peer-reviewed journal [Current Protocols](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpz1.442), presents a fast, scalable and memory-efficient methodology for targeted error resolution and automated finishing of long-read genome assemblies. The ntEdit+Sealer protocol, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntedit_sealer_protocol), was initially designed to polish (any) draft genome assemblies with short sequencing reads. It is being extended to also work with k-mers sourced from erroneous long reads; This work will be presented at ISMB-HiTSeq, stay tuned.
