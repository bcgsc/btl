title: "AMPlify, our machine learning method for predicting putative antimicrobial peptides is published"

In our peer-reviewed manuscript, just published in the journal [BMC Genomics](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08310-4), we present a novel and robust attentive deep learning model, named AMPlify. In the research manuscript, we show how AMPlify was used to predict antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from the Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana (bullfrog) genome. We also demonstrate the bioactivity of these AMPs against multiple species of bacteria, including multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli.
