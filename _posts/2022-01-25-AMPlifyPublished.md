In our peer-reviewed manuscript, just published in the journal [BMC Genomics](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-022-08310-4), we present a novel and robust attentive deep learning model, named AMPlify, in predicting antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) from the Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana (bullfrog) genome. We also demonstrate the bioactivity of these AMPs against multiple species of bacteria, including multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli.
