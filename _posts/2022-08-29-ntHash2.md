Our manuscript presenting ntHash2: recursive spaced seed hashing for nucleotide sequences has been published in [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btac564). ntHash2 builds ontop of our popular k-mer and spaced seed nucleotide sequence hashing algorithm, ntHash, with a faster and improved implementation. ntHash2 is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/nthash).
