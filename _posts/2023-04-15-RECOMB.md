The 27th Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology ([RECOMB 2023](http://recomb2023.bilkent.edu.tr/)) was held in Istanbul, Turkey) from April 14-19, 2023. The Bioinformatics Technology Lab presented various new algorithms and data structures developed by the group in the past year, including unique+conserved region detection in genome sequences with [unikseq](https://github.com/bcgsc/unikseq), k-mer repeat profiler [ntHits](https://github.com/bcgsc/nthits) and data structure based on stochastic tile hashing, [Stash](https://github.com/bcgsc/stash).
