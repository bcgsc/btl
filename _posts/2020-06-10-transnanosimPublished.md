category: news  
---  
This is our second publication on the NanoSim tool, describing a functionality to simulate nanopore reads for transcriptome sequencing experiments. Trans-NanoSim was published in [GigaScience](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giaa061) and is an integral part of the NanoSim project, freely available from [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/nanosim).
