We are delighted to announce that our paper, [ntRoot: computational inference of human ancestry at scale from genomic data](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbaf287), is now published in *Bioinformatics Advances*.  

**ntRoot** is a computationally lightweight and scalable method for inferring human ancestry directly from sequencing data—whether complete genomes, draft assemblies, or raw reads. By leveraging an alignment-free, reference-guided SNV detection framework and succinct Bloom filters, ntRoot achieves high accuracy and efficiency in predicting global and local ancestry.  

This work demonstrates ntRoot’s ability to process hundreds of genomes within hours while maintaining concordance with traditional methods, providing an accessible and powerful tool for large-scale cohort studies and population genomics.
