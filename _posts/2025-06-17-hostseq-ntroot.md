We are excited to share our latest study, [Concordance and Dissonance: A Genome-wide Analysis of Self-declared versus Inferred Ancestry in 10,250 Participants from the HostSeq Cohort, now available on bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.10.658783).

In this large-scale application of our [ntRoot ancestry inference method](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntroot), we analyze real-world genomic data from the [Canadian HostSeq initiative](https://www.cgen.ca/programs/hostseq). The analysis reveals patterns of concordance and discrepancy between self-reported and genetically inferred ancestry across a diverse population. It also demonstrates the scalability of ntRoot for population-scale genomics and underscores the importance of accurate ancestry inference in medical and genetic research.
