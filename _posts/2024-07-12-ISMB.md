category: conference  
---  

The 32nd International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB 2024) is held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada from July 12-16, 2024. We are excited to announce that the Birol Lab will be [presenting at the conference](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2024/programme-schedule/scientific-programme/evolcompgen) our latest research advancements, which include: the DNA sequence minimizer-based multi-genome synteny utility [ntSynt](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntsynt) and the sequence alignment-free ancestry inference technology [ntRoot](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntroot).

Oral Presentation:

Lauren Coombe, Rene L Warren, Parham Kazemi, Johnathan Wong, Inanc Birol (presenter). "ntSynt: Multi-Genome Synteny Detection Using Minimizer Graph Mappings" Presented at ISMB 2024, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The participation of Lauren Coombe at ISMB 2024 is supported by PHSA's Growth and Development Fund. Join us in Montreal to see how ntSynt and ntRoot are setting new standards in genomics research.
