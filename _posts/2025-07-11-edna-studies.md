In three new publications, our team and collaborators continue to advance the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for species monitoring, conservation, and ecosystem health assessment; Efforts that are increasingly vital in our rapidly changing world.

In [Molecular Ecology Resources (Lopez et al. 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.70014), we introduce [unikseq2](https://github.com/bcgsc/unikseq), a fast and scalable tool for identifying conserved and unique genomic regions without requiring sequence alignments. Unikseq2 enables efficient design of broad-spectrum eDNA assays by automating marker selection across large mitochondrial datasets. We showcase its utility in developing group-level assays for taxa including bony fishes, salmonids, Myotis bats, and Cervus deer, advancing the flexibility and reproducibility of eDNA-based biodiversity monitoring.

In [Environmental DNA (Langlois et al. 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1002/edn3.70139) we present a suite of qPCR-based eDNA assays for 125 taxa of significance to North America, developed with input from government agencies, field experts, and Indigenous groups. These assays support species identification across a wide range of ecological contexts, providing actionable tools for conservation and environmental management.

In a study published in [Marine Pollution Bulletin (Acharya-Patel et al. 2025)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2025.118036), we demonstrate how targeted eDNA testing can be used to monitor the impact of marine pollution in the Pacific Northwest. This study applies quantitative eDNA methods to detect biological signals of pollution exposure in marine ecosystems, offering a cost-effective and sensitive approach for environmental assessment.

These contributions build on our labâ€™s longstanding commitment to developing scalable bioinformatics tools that support eDNA assay design, from [mtGrasp](https://www.github.com/bcgsc/mtgrasp) for mitogenome assemblies, [unikseq](https://www.github.com/bcgsc/unikseq) for unique and conserved sequence identification, and mitogenome workflows to downstream analytical pipelines. By enabling the development of high-specificity, high-throughput molecular assays, we aim to empower researchers, regulators, and Indigenous communities in their stewardship of biodiversity and ecological health. Together, these efforts highlight the power of bioinformatics-driven eDNA technologies for rapid, accurate, and scalable species detection, reinforcing their essential role in conservation biology and environmental monitoring in an era of accelerating change.
