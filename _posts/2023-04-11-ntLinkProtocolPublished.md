After introducing ntLink, our minimizer mapping-based long-read genome assembly scaffolder, as part of the [LongStitch](https://github.com/bcgsc/longstitch) pipeline, we added multiple important new features to the tool, which are described in our recently published paper in [Current Protocols](https://doi.org/10.1002/cpz1.733). These new ntLink features include overlap detection, gap-filling and liftover-based iterations, each of which enable users the generate higher quality final assemblies. The protocol paper includes detailed descriptions of the features as well as step-by-step instructions for how to use them. Furthermore, we highlight that the minimizer-based mapping functionality in ntLink can be used independently for other downstream applications, such as misassembly detection. Our ntLink toolkit is freely available from [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntLink).
