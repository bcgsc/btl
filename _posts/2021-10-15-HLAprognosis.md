In our peer-reviewed manuscript, just published in the journal [PeerJ](http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12368), we report on observations linking host HLA alleles with COVID-19, some of which (eg. C*04:01 and HLA*11:01) are corroborated by different research groups and in different COVID-19 patient cohorts.
