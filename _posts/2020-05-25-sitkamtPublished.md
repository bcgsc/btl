Our study describing the genome sequencing of the Sitka spruce mitochondrial genome was accepted for publication in [Genome Biology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evaa108). In the manuscript we present the complete 5.5 Mb genome, one of the largest mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm, assembled from Oxford Nanopore long reads and describe its complex physical structure.
