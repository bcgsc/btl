We just published on btllib: a C++ library with Python bindings for efficient genomic sequence processing in [The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04720). The btllib library is implemented in C++, and includes a high-level & easy-to-use Python interface; The btllib code library includes specialized sequence-processing algorithms with efficiency and scalability in mind for small-to-(very)-large genome applications. It is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/btllib).
