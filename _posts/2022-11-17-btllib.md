We just published on btllib: a C++ library with Python interface for efficient genomic sequence processing in [The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04720). The btllib library is implemented in C++ with Python bindings available for a high level interface and ease of use; It focuses on specialized sequence-processing algorithms with efficiency and scalability in mind with small-to-(very)-large genome applications. btllib is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/btllib).
