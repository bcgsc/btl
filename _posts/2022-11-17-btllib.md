We just published on btllib: a C++ library with Python bindings for efficient genomic sequence processing in [The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04720). The btllib library is implemented in C++, includes a high-level & easy-to-use Python interface, and is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/btllib). The btllib common code library includes specialized DNA/RNA/protein (amino acid) sequence-processing algorithms with efficiency and scalability in mind for small-to-(very)-large genome and omics applications.
