We are excited to announce the publication of our manuscript, [ntSynt: scalable multi-genome synteny using an alignment-free minimizer graph](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-025-02455-w), in *BMC Biology*.

**ntSynt** is a fast and scalable tool for multi-genome synteny detection that enables comparative genomics across diverse species without relying on computationally expensive whole-genome alignments. By using an alignment-free, minimizer graph–based approach, ntSynt efficiently identifies conserved genome structure across reference-grade assemblies.

We demonstrate ntSynt’s performance on large vertebrate genomes and multi-species bee datasets, achieving high synteny coverage while using modest computational resources. This makes ntSynt well suited for evolutionary genomics, non-model organism research, and large-scale comparative studies across the tree of life.
