In our upcoming Letter to the Editor, slated for publication in the journal [HLA: Immune Response Genetics](https://doi.org/10.1111/tan.15355), we delve into the statistically significant association between the HLA-C*04:01 allele and COVID-19 severity. This association, initially reported by our group in [2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.27.20220863) and [2021](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12368), has been replicated in multiple studies, including the extensive [CanCOGeN CGEn HostSeq](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12863-023-01128-3) COVID-19 patient cohort (n=9,460). Our mini-review on the subject offers value not only to researchers engaged in COVID-19 association analyses but also to those exploring the involvement of HLA alleles in severe COVID-19 cases. In our Letter to the Editor, we recognize the challenges associated with replicating HLA associations and emphasize the significance of these discoveries in comprehending the genetic determinants of COVID-19 severity across various populations.
