Our manuscript, published in the peer-reviewed journal [Dna](https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8856/2/2/9#cite), presents Physlr, a tool that leverages long-range information provided by linked read sequencing technologies to construct next-generation physical maps. These maps have many potential applications in genome assembly and analysis, including, but not limited to, scaffolding. In our study, using experimental linked-read datasets from two humans, we used Physlr to construct chromosome-scale physical maps of the corresponding genomes, showcasing its utility for improving the contiguity of baseline draft genome assemblies. [Physlr is available on GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/physlr).
