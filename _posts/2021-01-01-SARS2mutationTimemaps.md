A report describing our SARS-CoV-2 variant analysis and [interactive SVG mutation maps freely available to the community for browsing and sharing](https://bcgsc.github.io/SARS2) was just announced at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15697). The maps report nucleotide changes in over 220,000 genomes (and their effect on gene products) over time and in different continents and countries compared to that of the first COVID-19 patient isolate made public.
