A report describing our SARS-CoV-2 variant analysis and [interactive SVG mutation maps freely available to the community for browsing and sharing](https://bcgsc.github.io/SARS2) was just published at [F1000research](https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.50857.1). It was announced earlier at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15697). The maps report nucleotide changes in over 2.5 million SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genomes (and their effect on gene products) over time and in different continents and countries compared to that of the first COVID-19 patient isolate made public.
