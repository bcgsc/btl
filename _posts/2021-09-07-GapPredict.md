In our peer-reviewed manuscript, just published in the journal [IEEE-TCBB](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9528958), we report on a novel application, GapPredict, for resolving gaps in genome sequence assemblies. This proof-of concept study demonstrates the practical utility of deep-learning machine learning models for this task.
