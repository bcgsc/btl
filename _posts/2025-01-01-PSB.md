The 30th [Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB)](https://psb.stanford.edu/), held in Kona, Hawaii, from January 4-8, 2025, is an international and multidisciplinary conference dedicated to showcasing and discussing cutting-edge research in computational methods for solving problems of biological significance. This year, we are excited to present our latest advancements in ancestry inference using modern DNA sequencing technologies with [ntRoot](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntroot).

[Presentation](https://f1000research.com/posters/13-1021):

Rene L Warren, Lauren Coombe, Johnathan Wong, Parham Kazemi, Inanc Birol. "ntRoot: Human ancestry inference at scale from genomic data" Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Kona, Hawaii, USA. January 2025.

The participation of Rene Warren at PSB2025 is partly supported by PHSA's Growth and Development Fund. Join us in Hawaii to see how ntRoot is setting new standards in genomics research.
