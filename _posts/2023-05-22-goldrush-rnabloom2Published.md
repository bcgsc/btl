Our de novo long read genome assembler, [GoldRush](https://github.com/bcgsc/goldrush), and reference-free long read transcriptome assembler, [RNA-Bloom2](https://github.com/bcgsc/rnabloom), were published today. See the [Nat. Commun. manuscript for GoldRush](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38716-x) and [Nat. Commun. manuscript for RNA-Bloom2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-38553-y), respectively. The GoldRush long read assembler marks a paradigm shift in long read de novo assembly of large genomes, generating highly contiguous assemblies using an order of magnitude less RAM than state-of-the-art Overlap-Layout-Consensus long read assemblers. RNA-Bloom2 is a reference-free assembler for long-read transcriptome sequencing data that requires a fraction of the peak memory and runtime needed by a competing method.
