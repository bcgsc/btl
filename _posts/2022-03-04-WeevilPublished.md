In our peer-reviewed manuscript, just published in the journal [G3: Genes|Genomes|Genetics](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkac038), we present the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes and associated annotations of the forest insect pest Pissodes strobi, commonly known as the spruce weevil or white pine weevil, a major pest of spruce and pine forests in North America. We also describe the genome of an apparent Wolbachia endosymbiont believed to form parasitic relationships with their arthropod host.
