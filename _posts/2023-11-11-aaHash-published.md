Our manuscript showcasing aaHash has been published in the [Bioinformatics Advances journal](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbad162). Hashing algorithm aaHash adapts the ntHash algorithm for amino acid sequences and features different hashing levels to represent the biochemical similarities of amino acids. In our tests, aaHash is âˆ¼10X faster than generic string hashing algorithms.
