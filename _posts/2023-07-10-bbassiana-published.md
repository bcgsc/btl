Our study on the genomics and transcriptomics characterization of Beauveria bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus used as a biological agent in agriculture and forestry, was just [published in BMC genomics](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-023-09473-4). It is of particular interest as a biocontrol agent for the invasive mountain pine beetle (MPB) Dendroctonus ponderosae, a wood-boring insect native to western North America that attacks a wide range of pine trees including lodgepole, ponderosa, western white, whitebark, limber and jack pine, causing extensive tree mortality.
Driven by climate change and wildfire suppression, a recent MPB outbreak has spread across more than 18 million hectares, including areas to the east of the Rocky Mountains that comprise populations and species of pines not previously affected. Despite its impacts, there are only a few tactics available to control MPB populations, which includes the use of B. bassiana in field applications. Our work investigates the phenotypic and genomic variation between B. bassiana strains to identify optimal strains against a specific insect.
