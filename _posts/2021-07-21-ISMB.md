category: conference  
---  

The joint 29th conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology and the 20th European Conference on Computational Biology ([ISMB/ECCB 2021](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2021)) meeting is held online July 25-30 and the BTL group will be there, presenting several new bioinformatics technologies and analysis workflow developed by our lab. These include [ABySS 2.5 genome assembly](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/NikolicVladimir_HitSeq_ISMB2021.pdf), [LongStitch genome scaffolding](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/CoombeLauren_HitSeq_ISMB2021.pdf), [ntEdit/Sealer genome polishing](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/LiJanet_HiTSeq_ISMB2021.pdf), [rAMPage AMP discovery](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/LinDiana_GCB_ISMB2021.pdf) and [SARS-CoV-2 variant timemaps](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/WarrenRene_BioVis-COVID19_ISMB2021.pdf).
