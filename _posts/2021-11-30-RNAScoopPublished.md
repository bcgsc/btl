---  

Our manuscript describing an interactive visualization tool for transcripts in single-cell transcriptomes, RNA-Scoop, was just published in [NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/nargab/lqab105/6445923). In the manuscript, we show that RNA-Scoop allows users to examine differential transcript expression across clusters and investigate how usage of specific transcript expression mechanisms varies across cell groups.
RNA-Scoop is freely available from [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/RNA-Scoop).
