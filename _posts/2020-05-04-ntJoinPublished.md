---  

Our manuscript describing ntJoin, a fast and lightweight reference-guided scaffolder, was published in [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa253). Instead of alignments, ntJoin uses a mapping approach based on a graph data structure generated from ordered minimizer sketches. ntJoin can be used in a variety of different research applications, including improving a draft assembly with a reference-grade genome, a short-read assembly with a draft long-read assembly and a draft assembly with an assembly from a closely related species. ntJoin is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/ntjoin).
