Our Letter to the Editor, just published in the peer-reviewed journal [Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa756), reports on the HLA profiles derived from the metatranscriptomic RNA-Seq samples of eight COVID-19 patients at the pandemic onset. Our study highlights the central role of HLA in vaccine development and host immunity in the current context, and adds perspective to host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic.
