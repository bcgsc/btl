Our manuscript presenting rAMPage: Rapid Antimicrobial Peptide Annotation and Gene Estimation has been published in [Antibiotics](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/11/7/952). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great potential as effective alternatives to small molecule antibiotics in the race against antibiotic resistance. In this manuscript, we present rAMPage, a scalable high-throughput bioinformatics pipeline for AMP discovery, and demonstrate its utility in the discovery of 7 active AMPs from amphibian and insect transcriptomes. These 7 active AMPs have been shown to be active against <i>E. coli</i> and <i>S. aureus</i> with minimal toxicity, and are promising candidates for further development in therapeutics. rAMPage is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgsc/rAMPage).
