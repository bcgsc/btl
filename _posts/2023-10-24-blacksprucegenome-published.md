Our manuscript presenting and analyzing the black spruce genome has been published in the [G3 journal](https://doi.org/10.1093/g3journal/jkad247). Black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.) is a dominant conifer species in the North American boreal forest that plays important ecological and economic roles and its genome assembly (18.3 Gbp) and annotation (66,332 protein-coding sequences predicted) are valuable resources for forest genetics research and applications in this broadly distributed species, especially in relation to climate adaptation.
