We are excited to share our [latest publication in Protein Science](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.70083), featuring AMPlify, a machine learning-based tool developed at Birol Lab to identify antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).

Antimicrobial resistance is a growing global threat, and AMPs offer a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics, yet their discovery remains a challenge. In Li et al. (2025), we leveraged AMPlify to mine the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database, identifying 8008 novel putative AMPs. Of these, 13 showed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus. This study highlights the power of deep learning in accelerating AMP discovery for real-world applications. By integrating sequence features and deep learning, AMPlify enables scalable and accurate AMP discovery, paving the way for novel antimicrobial therapeutics.
