title: "Scientific abstracts describing long sequencing read genome assembler GoldRush and data structure Stash, accepted for oral presentations at ISMB 2022"  
category: conference  
---  

The 30th conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology ([ISMB 2022](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2022)) is taking place in Madison, WI (USA) July 10-14, 2022 and the BTL group will attend in person to showcase our work on <i>de novo</i> long read genome assembler with linear time complexity, GoldRush, and its key components (golden path algorithm GoldRush-Path, long read scaffolder GoldRush-Link and long read polisher GoldRush-Edit). We will also present [btllib]( https://www.github.com/bcgsc/btllib), a C++ code library with Python interface we built for efficient sequence processing and introduce a new data structure for describing nucleotide sequences with lossy representation, Stash (based on stochastic tile hashing), which can be used to efficiently store and query sequence mapping information.
