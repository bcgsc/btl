title: "Introducing AMPd-Up - Enhancing De Novo Antimicrobial Peptide Design"

We are excited to share the publication of "De novo synthetic antimicrobial peptide design with a recurrent neural network" in the journal [Protein Science](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5088). In our study, we introduce [AMPd-Up](https://github.com/bcgsc/ampd-up), a recurrent neural network tool developed for <i>de novo</i> antimicrobial peptide (AMP) design. AMPd-Up utilizes in silico sequence generation to efficiently explore the vast sequence space of AMPs. Validation through antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated that 40 out of 58 sequences designed by AMPd-Up exhibited antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus. This approach showcases AMPd-Up's potential to facilitate the creation of novel synthetic AMPs with potent antimicrobial properties. For further details on AMPd-Up and its implications for antimicrobial peptide research, read the [full article](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5088)!
