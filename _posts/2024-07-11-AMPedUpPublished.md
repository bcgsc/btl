We are excited to announce the publication of "De novo Synthetic Antimicrobial Peptide Design with a Recurrent Neural Network" in the journal [Protein Science](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5088). In this study, we present [AMPd-Up](https://github.com/bcgsc/ampd-up), a novel recurrent neural network tool developed for <i>de novo</i> antimicrobial peptide (AMP) design. AMPd-Up leverages <i>in silico</i> sequence generation to efficiently explore the vast sequence space of AMPs. Validation through antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed that 40 out of 58 sequences designed by AMPd-Up exhibited antimicrobial activity against <i>Escherichia coli</i> and/or <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. This innovative approach highlights AMPd-Upâ€™s potential to facilitate the creation of novel synthetic AMPs with potent antimicrobial properties. For more information on AMPd-Up and its implications for antimicrobial peptide research, read the [full article](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5088)!
