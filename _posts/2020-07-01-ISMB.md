The annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology ([ISMB 2020](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2020)) will be held online July 13-16 and the BTL group is having a strong presence, presenting several new bioinformatics technologies including (posters + talks below) [Meta-NanoSim](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/562_Lo_Theodora_Microbiome_ISMB2020.pdf), [ntJoin](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/83_CoombeLauren_HitSeq_ISMB2020.pdf), [Physlr](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/491_Afshinfard_Amirhossein_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.png), [RNA-Scoop](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/338_Stephenson_Maria_BioVis_ISMB2020.pdf) and [RResolver](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/195_Nikolic_Vladimir_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.pdf).

##### Posters:
ID#562 by <strong>Theodora Lo</strong> at Microbiome COSI, [Meta-NanoSim](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/562_Lo_Theodora_Microbiome_ISMB2020.pdf): metagenome simulator for nanopore reads
<br>
ID#83 by <strong>Lauren Coombe</strong> at HiTSeq COSI, [ntJoin](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/83_CoombeLauren_HitSeq_ISMB2020.pdf): Fast and lightweight assembly-guided scaffolding using minimizer graphs
<br>
ID#491 by <strong>Amirhossein Afshinfard</strong> at HiTSeq COSI, [Physlr](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/491_Afshinfard_Amirhossein_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.png): de novo chromosome-level genome assemblies enabled by the physical map of linked reads
<br>
ID#338 by <strong>Maria Stephenson</strong> at BioVis COSI, [RNA-Scoop](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/338_Stephenson_Maria_BioVis_ISMB2020.pdf): interactive visualization of isoforms in single-cell transcriptomes
<br>
ID#195 by <strong>Vladimir Nikolic</strong> at HiTSeq COSI, [RResolver](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/195_Nikolic_Vladimir_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.pdf): short read repeat resolution with sliding window

##### Talks:
COOP student <strong>Maria Stephenson</strong> will be presenting [RNA-Scoop](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/338_Stephenson_Maria_BioVis_ISMB2020.pdf) at the BioVis COSI. <strong>Maria</strong> and graduate student <strong>Ka Ming Nip</strong> jointly developed RNA-Scoop, an interactive Java application to visualize isoforms in single-cell transcriptomes.

Intern <strong>Theodora Lo</strong> will be presenting [Meta-NanoSim](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/562_Lo_Theodora_Microbiome_ISMB2020.pdf) at the Microbiome COSI. Theodora and graduate student <strong>Chen Yang</strong> co-developed Meta-NanoSim, a metagenome nanopore read simulator. 

Congratulations <strong>Maria</strong> and <strong>Theodora</strong> for receiving ISCB fellowships!
