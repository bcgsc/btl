The annual International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology [ISMB 2020](https://www.iscb.org/ismb2020) will be held online July 13-16, 2020 and the BTL group is having a strong presence, presenting (poster+talks below) several new bioinformatics technologies including [Meta-NanoSim](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/562_Lo_Theodora_Microbiome_ISMB2020.pdf), [ntJoin](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/83_CoombeLauren_HitSeq_ISMB2020.pdf), [Physlr](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/491_Afshinfard_Amirhossein_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.png), [RNA-Scoop](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/338_Stephenson_Maria_BioVis_ISMB2020.pdf) and [RResolver](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/195_Nikolic_Vladimir_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.pdf).

##### Posters:

<br>
ID#83 by <b>Lauren Coombe</b> at HiTSeq COSI, [ntJoin](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/83_CoombeLauren_HitSeq_ISMB2020.pdf): Fast and lightweight assembly-guided scaffolding using minimizer graphs
<br>
ID#491 by <b>Amirhossein Afshinfard</b> at HiTSeq COSI, [Physlr](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/491_Afshinfard_Amirhossein_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.png): de novo chromosome-level genome assemblies enabled by the physical map of linked reads
<br>
ID#338 by <b>Maria Stephenson</b> at BioVis COSI, [RNA-Scoop](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/338_Stephenson_Maria_BioVis_ISMB2020.pdf): interactive visualization of isoforms in single-cell transcriptomes
<br>
ID#195 by <b>Vladimir Nikolic</b> at HiTSeq COSI, [RResolver](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/195_Nikolic_Vladimir_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.pdf): short read repeat resolution with sliding window

##### Talks:
COOP student <b>Maria Stephenson</b> will be presenting [RNA-Scoop](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/338_Stephenson_Maria_BioVis_ISMB2020.pdf) at the BioVis COSI. <b>Maria</b> and graduate student <b>Ka Ming Nip</b> jointly developed RNA-Scoop, an interactive Java application to visualize isoforms in single-cell transcriptomes.

Intern <b>Theodora Lo</b> will be presenting [Meta-NanoSim](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/562_Lo_Theodora_Microbiome_ISMB2020.pdf) at the Microbiome COSI. Theodora and graduate student <b>Chen Yang</b> co-developed Meta-NanoSim, a metagenome nanopore read simulator. 

Congratulations <b>Maria</b> and <b>Theodora</b> for receiving ISCB fellowships!
