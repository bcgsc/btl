ID#195 by Vladimir Nikolic at HiTSeq COSI, [RResolver](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/195_Nikolic_Vladimir_HiTSeq_ISMB2020.pdf): short read repeat resolution with sliding window

##### Talks: RNA-Scoop and Meta-NanoSim
COOP student Maria Stephenson will be presenting [RNA-Scoop](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/338_Stephenson_Maria_BioVis_ISMB2020.pdf) at the BioVis COSI. Maria and graduate student Ka Ming Nip jointly developed RNA-Scoop, an interactive Java application to visualize isoforms in single-cell transcriptomes.

Intern Theodora Lo will be presenting [Meta-NanoSim](http://www.birollab.ca/assets/posts/562_Lo_Theodora_Microbiome_ISMB2020.pdf) at the Microbiome COSI. Theodora and graduate student Chen Yang co-developed Meta-NanoSim, a metagenome nanopore read simulator. 

Congratulations to Maria and Theodora for receiving ISCB fellowships!
