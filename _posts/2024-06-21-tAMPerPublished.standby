We are pleased to announce the publication of tAMPer, a new deep learning model for predicting peptide toxicity. Published under "Structure-aware deep learning model for peptide toxicity prediction," in the journal [Protein Science](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.5076), tAMPer integrates amino acid sequence composition with ColabFold-predicted peptide structures using graph and recurrent neural networks. In benchmark tests, the [tAMPer utility](https://github.com/bcgsc/tAMPer) achieved an F1-score of 68.7% on an AMP hemolysis dataset, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by 23.4%. Its performance on a protein toxicity benchmark also showed a 3.0% improvement over the same comparators. tAMPer aims to expedite AMP discovery by reducing reliance on costly toxicity screening experiments. tAMPer is set to catalyze antimicrobial research and accelerate the discovery and development of new peptide/protein-based biologics in our global fight against multi-drug resistant pathogens.
