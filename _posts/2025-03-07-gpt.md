title: "Targeted Long-Read Genome Assembly Polishing with GoldPolish-Target"
category: news 
---  

Long-read sequencing has revolutionized genome assembly, but achieving high accuracy remains a challenge. [Our latest publication in BMC Bioinformatics introduces GoldPolish-Target](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-025-06091-7), a novel tool designed to enhance targeted genome assembly polishing.

In Zhang et al. (2025), we present GoldPolish-Target, which refines genomic regions of interest with targeted polishing, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead. This approach is particularly valuable for high-precision genomic studies, clinical diagnostics, and reference genome curation.
